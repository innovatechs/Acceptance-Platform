        <summary>Not sure which sign-in to use?</summary>

        <p>You need to sign in with the same username and password every time you use My Service Canada
        Account.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When you first registered for a My Service Canada Account, you
                selected a particular sign-in method.
            </li>
            <li>
                You might have created a new GCKey user id and password just for
                this account, and written it down or saved it in a Password
                manager.
            </li>
            <li>
                Or when you registered, you may have decided to use your
                existing financial institution username and password rather than
                create a new GCKey for Service Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
                My Service Canada Account tied that particular sign-in username
                and password with your tax and benefit information. Use that
                same method every time you sign in.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you haven't already registered for a My Service Canada Account,
            <a href="#{registerUri}">
            register now.</a>
